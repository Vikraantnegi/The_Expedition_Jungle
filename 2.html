						<h2>Discovering new Cultures</h2>
						<p>We have this thinking that if you haven't seen the culture of a place where you are visiting, or if you haven't tried their cuisine or if you haven't talked with the locals, then it isn't worth the travel. So, we make sure we provide enough time for this too!</p>

						<p class="text1">Greetings to everyone, I am Shruti Pathak and I am a Delhite. So, being so close to the Northern Himalayas, I had always wished to do all the main treks, And thanks to The Expedition Jungle, I have completed around 3-4 treks till now. My last one was Kedarkantha, the winter trek. And this trek is really difficult considering the weather and the height, but again I was overwhelmed by seeing the organisation's work and their hospitality. Next is the Chandrashila with you. Thankyou;)Expedition Jungle.</p>
